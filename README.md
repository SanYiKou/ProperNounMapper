# PropNounMapper
This script is designed to convert proper nouns in an English-translated novel back to their original Chinese forms. Currently, it only supports the conversion of person names.

Despite my limited English skills and lack of knowledge in Python, I was able to complete this script with the help of ChatGPT and Copilot.
